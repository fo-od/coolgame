so basically this game is a 2d platformer (very original) made with SDL in C++

# *game*play

the goal of the game isnt final right now, but its basically going to be moving through levels,
trying to get to some kind of win zone. i want it to be fast paced but feel smooth to control.

the entire idea of this game came from an unfinished scratch (scratch.mit.edu) platformer i made some time ago,
and ive had the idea stuck in my head for years.

# *vis*uals

the game is going to be mainly black and white, with some color to make special things more visible when going fast.
the platforms and player arent going to be fancy, theyll just be rectangles/squares.
i will try my best to make it feel smooth though.

i want to make a logo for this little project too, because i just like to create art, and typography is cool.
this is really just something for after im done with the project, or if im bored of coding it.

***

i dont plan on properly releasing this game, since this is a personal project to learn c++.
but if i end up liking it, ill try to put it on itch or something.

i wont be making build instructions, but it shouldnt be hard to figure out
f you already know cmake. (btw this was developed on macos so idk what itll do for windows&linux)
